# Backend Service Diagnosis Report

## Issue Summary
- **Time**: 2025-07-25 09:09:31 CST
- **Problem**: Backend API returns 502 Bad Gateway after frontend deployment
- **Status**: Frontend deployment successful, backend service not responding

## Diagnostic Results

### Network Connectivity
- ✅ Port 3001 (Frontend): Accessible
- ✅ Port 8080 (Backend): Port open but no response
- ❌ API Response: Empty response from server

### Service Status
- Frontend: ✅ Successfully deployed (JS version: main.26532365.js)
- Backend: ❌ Not responding (502 Bad Gateway)
- Nginx: ✅ Running (proxying requests)

### Connection Issues
- SSH Direct: ❌ Connection refused 
- GitHub Actions: ✅ Available for remote operation

## Root Cause Analysis
The backend service (research-backend) failed to start after the last deployment. This could be due to:

1. **Service Start Failure**: systemctl start research-backend failed
2. **Python Dependencies**: Missing or incompatible dependencies
3. **Database Migration**: Migration script failure preventing service start
4. **Configuration**: Invalid .env or configuration files
5. **Port Conflict**: Another process occupying port 8080

## Resolution Plan
Since direct SSH access is blocked, using GitHub Actions to:
1. Force backend service restart via vps-update.sh
2. Execute database migration verification
3. Check and repair Python environment
4. Verify service startup and health

## Next Action
Deploy this diagnostic file to trigger GitHub Actions and force backend service restart.
